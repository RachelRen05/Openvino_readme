# Output Types
>> The inference results can be output in several types. One or more types can be enabled for any infernece pipeline.
## Topic Publishing
>> Specific topic(s) can be generated and published according to the given inference functionalities.</br>

## Image View Window
>> The original image and the inference results are rendered together and shown in a CV window.
## RViz Showing
>> The Rendered image (rendering inference results into the original image) was transformed into sensor_msgs::msg::Image topic, that can be shown in RViz application.
- RViz Published Topic
```/ros2_openvino_toolkit/image_rviz```([sensor_msgs::msg::Image](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/Image.msg))

## Service
>> Several ROS2 Services are created, expecting to be used in client/server mode, especially when synchronously getting inference results for a given image frame or when managing inference pipeline's lifecycle.</br>
