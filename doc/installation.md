# Installation
>> Intel releases 2 different series of OpenVINO Toolkit, we call them as [OpenSource Version](https://github.com/opencv/dldt/) and [Binary Version](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit). You may choose any of them to install.

**NOTE:** If you are not sure which version you would use, it is recommended for you to choose [Binary Version](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit), which can simplify your environment setup.
